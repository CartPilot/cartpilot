        <h1 class="text-center page-header">FAQs</h1>
        <h3 style="padding-top:50px">What is CartPilot?</h3>
        <p>CartPilot is the ultimate product launch platform. We turn great ideas into great products. Our team has extensive experience in launching consumer products and managing supply chains. We also aid in distribution and licensing.</p>
        <h3 style="padding-top:50px">Who uses CartPilot?</h3>
        <p>CartPilot is used by designers, inventors, and entrepreneurs. If you have a great idea for a product (or service), we’d love to help.</p>
        <p>We also provide a feed to promote recently launched products to our followers.
        <h3 style="padding-top:50px">What do I need to get started?</h3>
        <p>You need only a great idea for a product (or service) and our team can help fill in the blanks. Most submissions have completed the design and sourcing phase of product development, but we’re happy to help with those, too.</p>
        <h3 style="padding-top:50px">How long does it take to launch a product?</h3>
        <p>Our team will review your submission and follow up with a notice of approval (or rejection) within 24-48 hours. Once approved, our team will spend up to 30 days onboarding your product. Additional services like licensing and distribution may require a longer timeframe.</p>
        <h3 style="padding-top:50px">Does CartPilot provide financing?</h3>
        <p>Yes, we do! Prior to launch, you may elect to receive debt or equity financing for your product. If approved, debt financing allows you to retain ownership, but you will be required to make interest payments. Equity financing requires you to sell an ownership interest in your product.</p>
        <p>We also provide merchant cash advances to existing products.</p>
        <h3 style="padding-top:50px">Does CartPilot provide crowdfunding?</h3>
        <p>No, unfortunately we do not provide crowdfunding.</p>
        <h3 style="padding-top:50px">How do I protect my idea?</h3>
        <p>Our best product submissions are tied to one or more forms of intellectual property (trademark, utility patent, etc.). We highly recommend this, but we are happy to accept (and approve) generic products as well.</p>
        <p style="padding-top:50px">If your question remains unanswered, please <a href="log-in.html">log in</a> and submit it for a member of our team to review. We’ll do our best to get back to you in under 24 hours.</p>
